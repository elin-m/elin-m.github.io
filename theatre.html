					<h3>Observation</h3>
					<p>
						An observation of children was done at a cultural playground, with the aim of learning how children socialize and identify any potential problems. The main finding was that children mostly interacted with others through roleplay, for example while playing restaurant or shop.

					<h3>Co-Design with Children</h3>
					<p>
						To further explore the idea of roleplaying, we met with eight year old children to find out how they would like to roleplay. We asked them to design a character with superpowers they would like to be, and they got to do a short play. We also supplied a "magic box" which would help them make plays, and asked them what they thought the magic box did.

				</div>

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Ideation</h3>
					<p>
						An online anonymous brainstorming session was held to come up with design ideas using what we had learned from the previous two meetings with children. We each voted for ideas and then the popular ones were grouped together into more elborate ideas. We finally decided on the Theatre Maker, which helps assign characters and generates a plot for children to build on.

				</div>

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Evaluation</h3>
					<p>
						To evaluate the concept, we met with a group of children to test a low-fidelity version of the concept. The concept worked well: most children had no previous experience with theatre, but they really enjoyed the activity. We made some changes in how characters were assigned based on the children's wishes.

					<h3>Concept</h3>
					<p>
						The final concept is a mobile application for tablets that a group of children can use to each choose a character and its traits, collectively deicide on a setting for the play, and then be presented with a basic plot description around which they can start to act out a story. The collective decision done through the app, as well as those made on how the story turns out encourage the development of negotiation and other social skills.
