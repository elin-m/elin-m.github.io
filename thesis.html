			<h2>Driver Information Allocation Between Displays</h2>
			<h5>Master Thesis - Volvo Car Corporation &amp; Chalmers University - Spring 2016</h5>

			<p>
				Aim: To research the opportunities for how to allocate driver information between different displays in cars.

					<h3>Scope</h3>
					<p>
						This thesis focused on finding out how to best allocate driver information (traditional as well as more entertainment related) between the dashboard and a head up display projected on the windshield.<br /><br />The intended results were guidelines on which information belonged in which display, and how much duplication of information there should be.

					<h3>User Research</h3>
					<p>
						We conducted research with drivers to understand how they feel about the current information display layouts. The different methods we used were:
						<ul>
						<li>Think aloud task-completion drives</li>
						<li>Interviews</li>
						<li>Card sorting (of driver information into displays)</li>
						<li>Phone interviews</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Analyzing Data</h3>
					<p>
						All collected data were written on post-its and organized into themes in an affinity diagram.
					</p>
					<p>
						Insight statements could then be created from each idea in the themes. These statements summarized the data through a driver's perspective, helping us to empathize with the drivers.

				</div>

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Guideline Creation</h3>
					<p>
						The insight statements were combined and used to create guidelines as recommendations on how to design the display interfaces to best support drivers' needs.

					<h3>Allocation Model</h3>
					<p>
						We realized that, since many recommendations were made based on what properties the information had, it might be possible make a model showing the ideal placement of information based on its inherent properties. The allocation model is intended to help designers place the different information in the best possible display.

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>
					<p>
						To evaluate the guidelines and allocation model, paper prototypes were created that followed the recommendations made for four different scenarios. Each scenario was designed to assess the placement of one piece of information (in either the dashboard or the HUD), and was made in two version. One version followed the guidelines for the information being compared, while the same information was placed in the other display for the other version. The information being compared between the two versions acted as a representative of one of the information property categories from the allocation model.

				</div>

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Video Prototyping</h3>
					<p>
						After updating the model according to findings from the previous evaluation, we made video prototypes following similar scenarios as in the first evaluation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The prototypes were created with video footage through a driver's perspective, and edited with Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects.

				</div>

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Driver Evaluation</h3>
					<p>
						We recruited owners of cars with head up displays to participate in the evaluation of the prototype (and thus the guidelines). They watched both versions of three scenarios, and were asked questions about their opinions and preferences.

				<div class="side right">
					<h3>Final Result</h3>
					<p>
						The allocation model and guidelines were updated to incorporate findings from the evaluation. Both are designed to be used as a tool for designers when creating the layouts of the displays. Evidence from user studies and literature were included in the booklet as support for the recommendations.
